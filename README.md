# Overview

## Goal
This project aims to investigate the relationships and correlations between trip duration or trip distance in micro-mobility vehicles of scooters, bicycles, and mopeds, along with various factors in Austin, Texas.
The goals of this project are to identify correlations and trends between variables to help urban planners, companies such as Lime, and policymakers make better-informed decisions about micro-mobility infrastructure and services in the area. The findings from this project may also contribute to improving the usability and accessibility of micro-mobility options for people in Austin.
